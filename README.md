# Fun_with_image_processing
This project gives an exposure to engage in hands-on activities and challenges centered around understanding and applying various image processing techniques. These could involve working with software tools or programming languages such as Python (with libraries like OpenCV or PIL), to manipulate and analyze images.

# Introduction to the Course

This is an introductory course designed for people from any background who are completely new to the area of image processing. You will be learning various functions of OpenCV to manipulate images and videos.

## What Does This Course Aim to Achieve?

It aims to give hands-on practice of various OpenCV tools and functionalities with many example problems and their solutions to work on and understand the use of tools and functions of OpenCV. It also aims to make the learning experience fun by introducing many interesting warmup exercises at the end of each section.

## What Is Being Built in This Course?

There are three final capstone build projects:
1. A program to detect and count pulse on a pre-recorded video.
2. A program to cartoonize an image.
3. A program that detects and tracks a ball bouncing on the ground.

## Course Prerequisites

The course requires a student to know the basics of Python, PIP (package manager for Python), basic shell commands in Linux, and version control with GIT.
